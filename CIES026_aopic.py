"""
This component recreates the CIE S026 alpha-opic toolbox, for the selected alpha_opic datasets. Alpha-type needs to be defined as input. 
This follows the recipe of PerezSky/CIE_Skygen/HDR2DiscreteLumEx --> Spectralskydome/Spectralviewdome --> CCT2SPD/viewCCT2SPD --> RelativeCombinedSPD --> comb2CIES026 --> spd_input of this component.
"spd_input" needs to be 54 x 2 array of SPDs from 300 to 830 nms, separated by 10nm interval.
---
OWL (Occupant Well-being through Lighting) is developed by Marshal Maskarenj, for SCALE project funded by FNRS @ LOCI, UCLouvain.
    Inputs:
        Rel_comb_SPD: 2nm separated SPD from 380-730nm (176 values). Takes input from RelativeCombinedSPD component.
        alpha_type: (between 1 and 5) 1 for s-cone-opic, 2 for m-cone-opic, 3 for l-cone-opic, 4 for rhod-opic and 5 for melan-opic.
        net_illum: The overall illum at the horizontal plane or at the eye level. Connects to output from SCALE_RelativeCombinedSPD component.
    Output:
        illuminance: Factoring-in the photopic function * 683 (luminous efficacy in lum/W). This is in Lux.
        a_opic_irradiance: Factoring in the respective a_opic function, this data is in W/(sqm.sr)
        a_opic_ELR: a_opic Efficacy of Luminous Radiation, this is the same as 1000*{a_opic_irradiance/illuminance} and is in mW/lm
        a_opic_DER: a_opic Daylight (D65) efficacy ratio. This is {opic_ELR-for-source/opic_ELR-for-D65}. opic_ELR-for-D65 is 0.8173 (for 'S'), 1.4458 (for 'M'), 1.6289 (for 'L'),  1.4497 (for 'Rh') and 1.3262 (for 'mel') mW/lm, so this is unitless. 
        a_opic_EDI: a_opic Equivalent Daylight (D65) Illuminance. This is {illuminance*opic_DER}, and is in Lux ."""
