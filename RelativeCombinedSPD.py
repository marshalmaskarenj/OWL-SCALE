"""
This component follows the LRC circadian light combined calculator (REFER TO https://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/lightHealth/index.asp )
The illuminance from each patch is identified by multiplying the luminance data (input) for each source (or patch of sky) with sine factor of its altitudinal/foveal angle [6...,18...,30...,.,.90], and with 0.0433 steradians (size of each tregenza patch.) 
Emulating the LRC spreadsheet, the relative SPD (input) and respective illuminance (from input lum) combines to give RELATIVE COMBINED SPD.
The cumulative [relative combined] SPD of the Skydome or of the Viewdome, from 380 to 730nm is evaluated.
Works in conjunction with CCT2SPD or ViewCCT2SPD. 145 CCT values from either of these components is taken as input, and the generated 15515 values are the expected input for this component.
--
OWL (Occupant Well-being through Lighting) is developed by Marshal Maskarenj, for SCALE project funded by FNRS @ LOCI, UCLouvain.
    Inputs:
        SPD_5: The SPD values between 300-830nm for all 145 patches (15515 values for bins of 5nm).
        luminance: The patch luminance for the 145 patches (from CIE_Skygen or PerezSky or HDR2DiscreteLum components).
    Output:
        Rel_comb_SPD: Relative combined SPD between 380-730nm for the entire skydome on the horizontal plane, or for the viwedome on the foveal plane (176 values for 2nm bins). 
        patch_illum: Individual illuminance contributions on the horizontal or foveal plane due to all patches at various positions.
        net_illum: Net illuminance on the horizontal plane or at the eye due to all patches. """
