# Occupant Wellbeing through Lighting V1.0 (15 Oct 2021)
This is the repository for Grasshopper-Python codes of OWL: an opensource workflow in Rhino Grasshopper developed for performing spectral lighting simulations, and evaluating non-image-forming effects of light on occupant wellbeing.

This tool uses minimal inputs for evaluating the following NIF metrics: Melanopic metrics (subset of alpha-opic metrics) recommended by CIE as part of CIES026 standard, and Circadian metrics proposed by Lighting Research Centre.

This is developed by Marshal Maskarenj at LAB/LOCI UCLouvain, along with Bertrand Deroisy and Sergio Altomonte; as part of the FNRS funded project SCALE (Shading Control Algorithms for Luminance Evaluation).
